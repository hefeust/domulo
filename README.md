# Domulo LIB USER's guide

Domulo is a VDOM implementation experiment with an alternate and fast way to store and do things. Its name comes from the use of MWC (Multiply With Carry) number generators used to store data inside Block Meory Pool internal data structure.

Domulo linearizes the VDOM n-ary tree structure so :

- it can be easily serialized and even more streamed
- it allows filtering nodes and querying against them
- it's designed to be fast and developper-friendly

It uses internally a Block Memory Pool (preallocated memory) which is a combination of an array of contiguous blocks and a lookup hashmap. This datastructure can hold other graph data structures such as Finite State Machines, Entity Relational Diagrams and many more.

## Goals

- fast query and filter Virtual Nodes
- ability to stream VDOM and VPatches
- Downside Garbage Coolection jerky cycles
- patch/unpatch real DOM (rollback = time travelling ability)
- encapsulation and securing (consistence safety) of VTREEs

## DISCLAIMER (WIP)

this is *actually* an experimental work and it is not suitable for production use. The work is in progress !

## How it works ?

based on a Blocks Memory Pool data structure. For ore informations [read this page](./guide/vdom-internals.md).

## Basic usage

1. create ian initialisation file in ypur root project folder, which imports domulo setup and re-export all symbols :

    ```
    // src/app/wrap.js
    // here we use rollup plugin alias in paths...
    import { wrap } from '@/src/domulo'
    
    // key is a 8-characters alhpanumeric string for salting internal generator
    export const domulo = wrap({ key: 'peACEful '})
    ```

2. Then every time you need to use domulo,invoke its wrapped version

    ```
     // src/app/todlo-list.js
    import { domulo } from 'src/app/wrap.js'

    const TodoList = (props) => {
       return domulo.h('section', {},
         domulo.h('h1', {}, 'Todo List Items'),
         domulo.h('ul', {},
           props.todos.map(todo =>
            domulo.h('li', {},
              domulo.h('p', {}, todo.litle +  ' ' + todo.done )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    }
    ```

3. src/app/ in your index.js put the following :

    ```
    import { domulo } from 'src/app/wrap.js'
    import { TodoList } from 'src/app/todo-list.js'

    // feed with some data
    const props = {
      todos: [
        { title: 'code', done: true },
        { title: 'test', done: false },
        { title: 'run', done: false }
      ]
    }
    const todolist = TodoList(props)

    domulo.mount(todolist, document.getElementById('div#app'))
    ```

Domulo is based on functional components. You can also use JSX.

## Quick Roadmap

* mount/diff/patch functions to implement
* serialize/deserialize/stream to implement
* documentation
* test and test again
